# rock-paper-scissors

Hello Everybody! This is my first ever amateur JavaScript program! Woohoo! Before I go any further, I am so sorry for the small number of commits! It totally slipped my mind as I was coding up this project and so I truly am sorry for the tiny amount of commit history, I hope to update it much better when I return to add the user interface. Other than that, I really hope anyone who sees this project has an enjoyable experience, take care!
